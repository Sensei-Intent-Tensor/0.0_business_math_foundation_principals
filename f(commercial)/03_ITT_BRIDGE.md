# Overview

Commercial Collapse Geometry (CCG) is a **domain instantiation** of Intent Tensor Theory (ITT). This document maps every CCG concept to its ITT parent, demonstrating mathematical inheritance.

# Operator Mappings

## ITT Operators → CCG Concepts

| ITT Operator | Symbol | CCG Instantiation | Commercial Meaning |
|--------------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Intent Field | Φ | Φ_seller, Φ_buyer | Actor intent potentials |
| Gradient | ∇Φ | Polarity vectors | Direction of commercial action |
| Divergence | ∇·F | Transaction collapse rate | Market clearing velocity |
| Laplacian | ∇²Φ | Collapse surface curvature | Market stability measure |
| Curl | ∇×F | Competitive vorticity | Market rotation dynamics |

## Role Mappings

From f(AutoWorkspace):

| Business Role | ITT Operator | CCG Parallel |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| CEO (Φ) | Intent Source | Market Maker |
| CIO (∇Φ) | Gradient Direction | Strategy Vector |
| COO (−∇²Φ) | Diffusion Sink | Operations Efficiency |
| CFO (+∇²Φ) | Concentration Source | Value Concentration |
| CHRO (∇×F) | Rotational Field | Talent Circulation |

# Tensor Inheritance

## Complex Intent Tensor

**ITT Definition:**
```
I_C = I_site + i · S_imag
```

**CCG Instantiation:**
```
I_C^{commercial} = CurrentYield + i · AdaptationCapacity
```

The imaginary component S_imag maps directly:
- ITT: "Structural capacity to absorb unborn vectors"
- CCG: "Capacity to absorb paths that don't exist yet"

## ICWHE Constraint

**ITT Form:**
```
Δ(Coherence) · Δ(Potential) ≥ ℏ
```

**CCG Form:**
```
Δ(ValueSpecificity) · Δ(MarketFlexibility) ≥ h_market
```

The uncertainty principle is domain-invariant. Only the constant changes.

# Equation Mappings

## From OVT to f_adaptive

**f(AutoWorkspace) OVT:**
```
V = A_ijk R^i I^j E^k
```

**CCG Adaptive Fitness:**
```
f_adaptive = |I_C| · Ψ(Π, h) · Authority_hybrid
```

**Mapping:**
| OVT Component | CCG Component |
|---------------|---------------|
| A_ijk (Interaction Tensor) | Ψ(Π, h) (ICWHE validity) |
| R^i (Resource) | Coherence |
| I^j (Intent) | \|I_C\| (Complex magnitude) |
| E^k (Execution) | Authority_hybrid |

## From θ_cohesion to S_imag/I_site

**f(AutoWorkspace):**
```
θ_cohesion = R_Align / R_Drift
```

**CCG:**
```
θ_commercial = S_imag / I_site
```

**Interpretation:**
- θ > 1: Roots growing faster than fruit decaying (survival)
- θ < 1: Fruit decaying faster than roots growing (extinction)

# Collapse Geometry Inheritance

## ITT Collapse Surface

In ITT, collapse occurs when intent field reaches critical gradient:
```
Collapse ⟺ ||∇Φ|| > Φ_threshold
```

## CCG Transaction Collapse

In CCG, collapse occurs when buyer-seller gap closes:
```
Transaction ⟺ ||Φ_buyer - Φ_seller|| < ε_market
```

**Mathematical Equivalence:**

Both are threshold crossings in field space. ITT uses gradient magnitude; CCG uses intent gap magnitude. The geometry is identical.

# Phase Transition Mechanics

## ITT Phase Transitions

Field discontinuities where:
```
M_{t^+} ≠ M_{t^-}
```

## CCG Market Transitions

Medium changes where:
```
OptimalConfig(M_{t^+}) ≠ OptimalConfig(M_{t^-})
```

Examples:
- Radio → Television
- Print → Digital
- Search → Social
- Social → AI

The mathematical structure is identical. Only the interpretation changes.

# The Canonical Law as ITT Theorem

## ITT Parent Theorem

"The imaginary component determines traversal of collapse surfaces."

## CCG Child Theorem (Canonical Tensor Law)

"S_imag growth rate exceeding obsolescence rate determines survival across phase transitions."

**Proof of Inheritance:**

1. ITT: Collapse surfaces are navigated via imaginary component
2. CCG: Phase transitions are collapse surface crossings in market space
3. Therefore: S_imag (imaginary) governs phase transition survival
4. Survival requires: d/dt S_imag > decay_rate
5. QED: CCG theorem follows from ITT axioms

# Implementation Bridge

## Python Class Hierarchy

```python
# ITT Parent (conceptual)
class IntentTensor:
    def __init__(self, real, imaginary):
        self.real = real
        self.imaginary = imaginary

# CCG Child
class ComplexIntentTensor(IntentTensor):
    def __init__(self, I_site, S_imag):
        super().__init__(real=I_site, imaginary=S_imag)
        self.I_site = I_site
        self.S_imag = S_imag
```

## Shared Mathematical Functions

Both ITT and CCG use:
- `magnitude()`: √(real² + imag²)
- `phase()`: arctan(imag/real)
- `collapse_check()`: threshold comparison
- `evolve()`: ODE integration

# Forward Extensions

## From CCG to Domain Instantiations

CCG itself can be parent to:

| Child Domain | Instantiation |
|--------------|---------------|
| f(commercial/digital) | AI discoverability, SEO |
| f(commercial/retail) | Physical store dynamics |
| f(commercial/B2B) | Enterprise sales cycles |
| f(commercial/finance) | Trading dynamics |

Each inherits CCG's:
- Transaction Collapse Theorem
- Complex Intent Tensor
- ICWHE Constraint
- Canonical Tensor Law

And instantiates domain-specific:
- ε_market values
- δ (obsolescence rates)
- S_imag proxies
