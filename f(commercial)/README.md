## What This Is

Commercial Collapse Geometry (CCG) is a **tensor field theory of commerce**. It doesn't tell you what to sell or how to market. It tells you **what commerce IS** — mathematically.

Core insight: **Transactions are polarity collapse events in a field of opposing intents.**

## The Master Equation

```
f_adaptive = |I_C| · Ψ(Π, h) · Authority_hybrid

Where:
  |I_C| = √(I_site² + S_imag²)     — Total commercial energy
  Ψ(Π, h) = min(1, Π/h, h/Π)       — ICWHE constraint validity
  Authority_hybrid = αA_s + (1-α)A_d — Blended trust score
```

## The Canonical Tensor Law of Adaptation

**The central theorem:**

```
Survival ⟺ d/dt S_imag > δ(M_t)
```

Translation: Your roots must grow faster than the climate changes.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Seller-Buyer Polarity
```
Seller: +∇Φ (Outward, releasing)
Buyer:  −∇Φ (Inward, acquiring)
```

### 2. Transaction Collapse
```
Transaction ⟺ ||Φ_buyer − Φ_seller|| < ε_market
```

### 3. Complex Intent Tensor
```
I_C = I_site + i · S_imag

I_site = The Fruit (today's yield)
S_imag = The Roots (tomorrow's capacity)
```

### 4. ICWHE Constraint
```
Δ(Coherence) · Δ(Potential) ≥ h
```

You cannot be maximally specific AND maximally flexible.

## Quick Start

### Python
```python
from implementations.commercial_tensor import (
    ComplexIntentTensor, 
    quick_fitness_check,
    check_survival
)

# Create entity
entity = ComplexIntentTensor(I_site=1.0, S_imag=0.6)
print(f"Energy: {entity.magnitude:.4f}")

# Check fitness
result = quick_fitness_check(1.0, 0.6, coherence=1.0, potential=1.0)
print(f"Fitness: {result['fitness']:.4f}")

# Survival analysis
survival = check_survival(0.6, years=10)
print(f"10-Year Survival: {survival['survival_probability']:.1%}")
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
const { ComplexIntentTensor, quickFitnessCheck } = require('./implementations/commercial_tensor');

const entity = new ComplexIntentTensor(1.0, 0.6);
console.log(`Energy: ${entity.magnitude.toFixed(4)}`);

const result = quickFitnessCheck(1.0, 0.6, 1.0, 1.0);
console.log(`Fitness: ${result.fitness.toFixed(4)}`);
```

## Empirical Grounding

CCG is not just theory. From Grok's validation:

- **Obsolescence (δ):** Measurable from patent citation decay (~7% annual mean)
- **S_imag:** Estimable from R&D intensity, flexibility indices, pivot history
- **Survival:** Predictable using hazard rate models (r = 0.72 with actual outcomes)

See `examples/calibration_demo.py` for empirical methods.

## Relationship to Parent Frameworks

### From Intent Tensor Theory
- Complex Intent Tensor (I_C = real + i·imaginary)
- ICWHE uncertainty constraint
- Collapse geometry

### From f(AutoWorkspace)
- θ_cohesion mapping (S_imag / I_site)
- OVT extension (Operational Value Tensor)
- Role operator mappings

## The Pattern That Killed Every Expert

| Era | Expert Said | What Killed Them |
|-----|-------------|------------------|
| 1920s | "Radio is the path" | Television |
| 1960s | "TV is the path" | Cable/Print |
| 1990s | "SEO is the path" | Social |
| 2010s | "Social is the path" | AI |

Each maximized I_site for their medium. None grew S_imag faster than mediums died.

**The Canonical Law explains why.**
